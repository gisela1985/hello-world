This is Lab 1 - Part B

I am Gisela in the branch readme-edits. I will write something about my self: I am from Argentina, I studied business administration and an MBA. I used to work for a Bank what it is really interesting because this industry is cricial all over the globe. 
My first job was as business intelligence analyst at Telefonica where I learnt SQL and I used for 7 years. After that at the bank, I did not have access to data warehouse, so I used Ms office - access and Excel intensively.

I love traveling therefore my husband and I visited many countries such as Brasil, Chile, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, UK, France, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. For the next holidays I look forward to visiting Spain where my brother has been living since 2018.
